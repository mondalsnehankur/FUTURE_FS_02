# CRM Backend – Lead Management System

This repository contains the backend implementation of a **CRM (Customer / Client Relationship Management) system**, developed as my **first backend project** using Node.js and Express.

The project focuses on understanding **server-side development fundamentals**, including REST APIs, routing, middleware, and request–response handling.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The CRM backend is designed to:
- Accept and store leads submitted from a frontend form
- Expose RESTful API endpoints for managing leads
- Serve as a foundation for a full-stack CRM application

This project emphasizes **clarity, structure, and learning-by-building** rather than complexity.
